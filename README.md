## Who am I
![Rachel](images/Rachel.png)

- My GitHub account is [@rachlobay](https://github.com/rachlobay)
- I ~~sometimes~~ like to code.
	+ I have dabbled in R, Java, and Python.
	+ Since I only know a handful of programming languages, I am interested in learning about others. I want to learn **MATLAB** eventually!


### A few things I enjoy

### Pirates of the Caribbean

Pirates of the Caribbean is a very quotable movie:
> Elizabeth: "There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing."
>
> Jack: "I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by."

This video is me during exams. My grades are sinking :chart_with_downwards_trend:, but I convince myself everything is fine and part of the plan. Here is an image still with a YouTube link so you can see a Jack Sparrow clip:

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to directly embed a YouTube video. If you would like to use the method I used, feel free to copy and modify the code below:

```
[![alt text for the image](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_ID/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_ID)
```

What you want to do is complete tasks:
- [ ] Find what your video code is from its url. For example, to get to the Jack Sparrow clip above the video code **isdvdrCPr3gDQ**
- [ ] Copy and paste the video code where it says **YOUTUBE_ID** in the code block above.
- [x] That's all folks!

## The end.
