# README for Homework 1

## What is this repository for?
This repository is for my Homework #1 for my [STAT 545A](http://stat545.com) class at UBC. The objective of Homework #1 task is to Edit README.md and Use R Markdown. 

This is a line that was pushed from RStudio.

## Who am I
![Rachel](images/Rachel.png)

- My GitHub account is [@rachlobay](https://github.com/rachlobay)
- I ~~sometimes~~ like to code.
	+ I have dabbled in R, Java, and Python.
	+ Since I only know a handful of programming languages, I am interested in learning about others. I want to learn **MATLAB** eventually!
- I majored in math in undergrad.
	+ A lot of people think that that Euler's identity, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e^{i\pi}&plus;1&space;=&space;0" title="e^{i\pi}+1 = 0" />, is the most beautiful equation in the world. In it, there are five numbers that are very important in the math world and three basic operations (+,- and *).
	
	You can read more about that equation [here](https://www.livescience.com/51399-eulers-identity.html).
	
	> "Euler's identity is amazing because it is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound" - David Percy 
	
	+ Can you name the following equations? Highlight the right of the equation to reveal the answer.
	
        - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a^2&space;&plus;&space;b^2&space;=&space;c^2" title="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" /> <span style="color:white"> Pythagorean Theorem</span>
  
        - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\int_{b}^{a}&space;f'(x)dx&space;=&space;f(b)&space;-&space;f(a)" title="\int_{b}^{a} f'(x)dx = f(b) - f(a)" /> <span style="color:white"> Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</span>
  
        - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{2}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{3}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{4}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{5}&space;&plus;&space;\frac{1}{6}&space;&plus;&space;...&space;=&space;\infty" title="1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + ... = \infty" /> <span style="color:white"> Harmonic Series</span>
  
        - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx&space;=&space;\sqrt{\pi}" title="\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}" /> <span style="color:white"> Gaussian Integral</span>
  
        - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\oint&space;P(x,y)&space;dx&space;&plus;&space;Q(x,y)&space;dy&space;=&space;\int&space;\int&space;\left&space;(&space;\frac{dQ}{dx}&space;-&space;\frac{dP}{dy}&space;\right&space;)&space;dx&space;dy" title="\oint P(x,y) dx + Q(x,y) dy = \int \int \left ( \frac{dQ}{dx} - \frac{dP}{dy} \right ) dx dy" /><span style="color:white"> Green's Theorem</span>
  
  **FYI:** I had a teacher who said the last equation is so great that he's thinking of getting a tattoo of it.

### A few things I enjoy
:airplane: :cat: :dog: :sunny: :coffee: :soccer: 

### Pirates of the Caribbean

Pirates of the Caribbean is a very quotable movie:
> Elizabeth: "There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing."
>
> Jack: "I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by."

This video is me during exams. My grades are sinking :chart_with_downwards_trend:, but I convince myself everything is fine and part of the plan. Here is an image still with a YouTube link so you can see a Jack Sparrow clip:

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/dvdrCPr3gDQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvdrCPr3gDQ)

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to directly embed a YouTube video. If you would like to use the method I used, feel free to copy and modify the code below:

```
[![alt text for the image](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_ID/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_ID)
```

What you want to do is complete tasks:
- [ ] Find what your video code is from its url. For example, to get to the Jack Sparrow clip above the video code **isdvdrCPr3gDQ**
- [ ] Copy and paste the video code where it says **YOUTUBE_ID** in the code block above.
- [x] That's all folks!

## The end.
