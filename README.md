# README for Homework 1

## What is this repository for?
This repository is for my Homework #1 for my [STAT 545A](http://stat545.com) class at UBC. The objective of Homework #1 task is to Edit README.md and Use R Markdown. 

This is a line that was pushed from RStudio.

## Who am I
![Rachel](images/Rachel.png)

- My GitHub account is [@rachlobay](https://github.com/rachlobay)
- I ~~sometimes~~ like to code.
	+ I have dabbled in R, Java, and Python.
	+ Since I only know a handful of programming languages, I am interested in learning about others. I want to learn **MATLAB** eventually!
- I majored in math in undergrad.
	+ A lot of people think that that Euler's identity is the most beautiful equation in the world. In it, there are five numbers that are very important in the math world and three basic operations (+,- and *).
	
	$e^{i\pi}+1 = 0$
	You can read more about that equation [here](https://www.livescience.com/51399-eulers-identity.html).
	
	> "Euler's identity is amazing because it is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound" - David Percy 
	
	+ Can you name the following equations? Highlight the line underneath the equation to reveal the answer.


  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
  \\ \color{white} {\text{Pythagorean Theorem}}$$
  
  $$\int_{b}^{a} f'(x)dx = f(b) - f(a)
  \color{white} {\text{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}}$$ 
  
  $$ F(n) = \frac{\varphi ^{n}-\left (-\frac{1}{\varphi} \right )^n}{\sqrt{5}} 
  \\ \color{white} {\text{Fibonacci Sequence Formula}}$$
  
  $$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6}  + ... = \infty  
  \\ \color{white} {\text{Harmonic Series}}$$
  
  $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}
  \\ \color{white} {\text{Gaussian Integral}}$$

  $$\oint P(x,y) dx + Q(x,y) dy = \int \int \left ( \frac{dQ}{dx} - \frac{dP}{dy} \right ) dx dy
  \\ \color{white} {\text{Green's Theorem}}$$
  
  FI once had a teacher who wouldn't mind a tattoo of this form

### A few things I enjoy

### Pirates of the Caribbean

Pirates of the Caribbean is a very quotable movie:
> Elizabeth: "There will come a time when you have a chance to do the right thing."
>
> Jack: "I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by."

This video is me during exams. My grades are sinking :chart_with_downwards_trend:, but I convince myself everything is fine and part of the plan. Here is an image still with a YouTube link so you can see a Jack Sparrow clip:

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/dvdrCPr3gDQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvdrCPr3gDQ)

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to directly embed a YouTube video. If you would like to use the method I used, feel free to copy and modify the code below:

```
[![alt text for the image](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_ID/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_ID)
```

What you want to do is complete tasks:
- [ ] Find what your video code is from its url. For example, to get to the Jack Sparrow clip above the video code **isdvdrCPr3gDQ**
- [ ] Copy and paste the video code where it says **YOUTUBE_ID** in the code block above.
- [x] That's all folks!

## The end.
